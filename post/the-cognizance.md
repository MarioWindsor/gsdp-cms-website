## A Colonnade Clubhouse in Bengaluru

Colonnaded courtyard has been the earliest and the simplest form of cultural gathering space in the Indian society. This idea was borrowed from the historical colonnaded temple complexes. We added to it a contemporary interpretation of the cultural space that suites the current lifestyle and cultural scenario.

Thus emerged "COGNIZANCE" as a combination of colonnades, enclosed, semi enclosed and open spaces that throw open multitude possibilities of its usage. A clubhouse designed for a proposed residential development.

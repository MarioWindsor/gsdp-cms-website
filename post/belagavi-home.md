The Belagavi city has a tropical wet and dry climate, this home is an interpretation of vernacular in itsessence, while contemporary in its language and expression. The idea of distilling and infusing the principlesof the vernacular architecture at its core, yet molding it to the needs of a modern family drove the process.

The home may well be described as a Glocal one, bringing the best of both worlds to the family. The exterior form of the home appears to be grounded to the earth while rising just as much as required.

Overall the proportion is horizontal, with most of the mass being down to earth, complemented by thevertically risen floors being roofed by vaults. A veneration to the earth.The variation in levels within the home opens up the space establishing a visual connection and allowinglight and breeze to sweep across the common spaces

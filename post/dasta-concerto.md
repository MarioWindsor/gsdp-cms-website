## A Jaali Apartment in Bengaluru

"The hidden harmony is better than the obvious" - Pablo Picasso

Concerto is about transcribing living spaces. It is about scaling heights in harmony . It is about enriching spaces by layering of rhythmic elements. Apart from well- planned and well-functional spaces, the "Jaali" wall forms a highlighting element in the building. The "Jaali" has ever since been the boast and privilege ofthe Indian Aristrocracy, as an element in palaces, hamams and zenanas. The Jaali renders the space, a warm beauty with its play of light and shadow, an exclusiveness of controlled privacy and yet gives the dweller his own share of window to the outside world.

## Apartment Interiors

An apartment unit layout is always designed with a hypothetical - generic family in consideration. Our main focus was to transform this generic flat into a HOME exclusive to the needs of Mr. Chandrashekhar's family. The apartment was given the much needed jugglery of existing space and meticulous organization of storage and habitable spaces to supplement their day-to-day activities. The idea was to reduce the time the family spends on the daily chores so that they may have more time for leisure.

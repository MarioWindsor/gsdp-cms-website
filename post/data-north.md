## A Family Focused Apartment in Bengaluru

This apartment block was about exploring the scope of volumes and planes bound only by the constraints of the plan. It was also an attempt to deal with Bengaluru's ever-changing climate. This includes the creation of two distinct lines of defense against rain and sun, a belt of auxiliary spaces such as verandahs, store rooms, utility and bay windows to form an insulating zone of thermal protection. The material palette is an expression of balance of both solidity and lightness. It also offers an interesting range of five design variations to suite various family needs.

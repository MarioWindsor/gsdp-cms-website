The conflict of luxury of space and optimum scaled space for convenience of use has never been an easy duel. With 51,000 sft of land available, where the sheer scale of space can be overpowering, building a home for a family of four was the challenge. We addressed this by augmenting the greater scale in the exterior with overpowering elements, but downplaying the scale in the interior and thus humanizing it.

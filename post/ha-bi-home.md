## Wood and Metal Interior 

The material palette is the majority of wood and metal along with cane & soft furnishings in earthy andnatural colors. In keeping with the natural palette of the design, indoor plants found their way into everyroom, bestowing lively energy on them.

The vertical lines lend themselves to the additional layer of storage in the form of shelves made in slender MS rods.

The fluted wooden panels wraps surface of various rooms, donning the role of a consonant characteristic of the common areas.

Once the overall language of the design was defined, we went on to carve out or define spaces which the family could personalize.

This is with the belief that a designers strength lies deviating from the rigidity of functionality of spaces, creating pockets for the user to personalize and explore themselves. Certain example of these being the art nook at the daughter's bedroom.

Once transformed in to home, it has a crispness in the grammar of the space and a warmth in it's language, which the family has embraced and made its own.

True to its name, *Vishwakutumb* was envisioned as a home that celebrates togetherness while nurturing the individuality of each family member.

Designed for a joint family with diverse talents and a broad-minded approach to all aspects of life, the house embodies a perfect blend of shared and private spaces. The structure is not just a home but a haven where each room tells a story. It offers communal spaces that promote family bonding and private zones for personal reflection and growth.

The architecture balances the delicate harmony between tradition and modernity, creating a space that feels both welcoming and forward-thinking.

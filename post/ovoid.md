## An All Encompassing Home for a Versatile Family

Ovoid , a second home commissioned by a family of coffee planters in Mudigere, Chickmangulaur. They had a modest requirement of a single storey three bedroom house , as a home where they would spend some time of the year and sometimes bring along family and friends.

A 1.5 acre parcel of land was earmarked by the client a midst a 100acre plantation. In order to avoid disturbing the existing coffee plants and trees , the house was sited on one side, closer to the approach road.

Attempting a linear mass aligned along north south, the house was approached via a laterite clad driveway, a part of the massing was scooped out to make room for two car park.

Wide Staggering steps in laterite formed a entrance courtyard, this had a low wide seater like laterite wall enclosure. Creating a threshold space between the inside and the outside close coffee plantation.

These threshold spaces are intrinsic to a program like this , it enriches the whole
experience as you enter and use it at different times of the day.

A laterite volume emerges from this courtyard plinth to house the foyer or the communal space of house, wrapped in a slatted wood lined with fine MS detailing ,protecting the interior while allowing a continuous relation with the outside. Seater like wide steps allow you to enter the living and dining at a slightly higher level.

The Living, dining is a large pavilion like open space. Large sliding doors leading to a verandah towards the east, brings in the soft eastern light in the
mornings. The verandah , extends out into a large lawn gradually merging into the coffee plantation.

Along the west of this family space intermediate solid timber panels were incorporated in the large glazed facade surface to reduce the harsh sun at the same time visually connect the occupants with the surrounding landscape at all times.

The kitchen and services occupy the end of this space in the north west, with easy access to the dining and the outdoor dining spaces. This whole 
arrangement of spaces extending into large threshold verandah spaces on both the east and western side, looking into the landscape allowed the family varied use and experiences.

This roof extends all along the linear block ,stops short on the services where we have a flat roof to house more services on the terrace.

During monsoon the roof profile facilitates collection of rain water , strategically positioned outlet pipes channelizes it to recharge the earth.
